Zuck is a tycoon style game played over text message focusing on social networks.

Every turn, the player is given an action; they can either take the action or skip the turn for a new action.

Actions usually take the form of new features to be implemented, but the user is also given the option to raise or lower the general obtrusiveness of advertisements, or even buy out rival companies.
