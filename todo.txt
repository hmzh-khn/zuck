1. Code is currently a mess from our switching of persistent data models. Hamzah will clean this up. He does not suggect trying to change code until he does so.

2. Stay with global variables until there is a stable codebase. Use ONLY the db module to interact with data.

3. Standardize and impove the parsing for commands that have parameters.

4. Reevaluate the buy and develop command implementations.
	a. Fix parsing of the commands and arguments
	b. Improve interaction AI algorithm
	c. Add complexity to the equations after basic function is integrated.

5. Generate events and be able to send them to the user.

6. Brainstorm new events and provide equations for how they may affect the player's company.

7. Reintegrate a database and hope that it doesn't fail. :p
